# CS2 AutoJump Script

This script automates jumping in Counter-Strike 2 (CS2), making it easier to perform actions like continuous jumping (bunny hopping). The script uses simple logic to trigger jumps as soon as the player lands, potentially enhancing movement speed and agility.

## Features

- Automatically triggers jumps when the player hits the ground.
- Enables smoother bunny hopping with minimal user input.
- Simple and easy-to-use solution for jump automation in CS2.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (only if the script is written in Python).
- AutoHotkey (if the script is written using AutoHotkey) [Download here](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    
    git clone https://github.com/deampgen/AutoJumpCS2.git
    cd cs2-autojump
    

2. Install dependencies if required (for example, pynput if the script is in Python):
    
    pip install pynput
    

## Usage

1. Open the script file and check the setup instructions if needed.
2. Launch Counter-Strike 2.
3. Run the script:
    
    python main.py
    
4. Start moving in-game, and the script will automatically perform jumps for you.

### Key Bindings

The script might use certain key bindings (e.g., Space for jumping). Make sure these bindings match your in-game settings. If needed, modify the key in the script to match your preferences.

## Important Notes

- Fair Play: Check the rules and policies of the servers or tournaments where you intend to use this script, as automated jumping might be restricted or banned.
- Anti-Cheat: Be cautious about using scripts in online games that have strict anti-cheat measures, as such software might flag or ban your account if it detects automation.
